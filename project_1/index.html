                <p>The Seven Wonders of the World are remarkable human-made structures celebrated for their architectural brilliance and historical significance. The original list, known as the **Seven Wonders of the Ancient World**, includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes, and Lighthouse of Alexandria. Of these, only the Great Pyramid still exists today. In 2007, a new list—the **New Seven Wonders of the World**—was announced after a global poll: the Great Wall of China, Petra in Jordan, Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen Itza in Mexico, the Roman Colosseum in Italy,.
